Xamarin Forms is certainly an exciting project, exiting but a little bit preliminary. The Athena project is setup for a number of purposes:

1. To demostrate the capabilities of Xamarin Forms
2. To show how to use Xamarin Forms as its documentation is neither completed nor thorought
3. To produce a bunch of high quality Xamarin Forms controls (with documents)
4. To burn my spare time

The development will focus on two platforms, iOS and android (en...let's see how windows 10 goes). But iOS will take the highest priority. It means the new features will always arrive at iOS one step (or many steps) ahead of android.
