Xamarin Forms is certainly an exciting project, exiting but a little bit preliminary. The Athena project is setup for a number of purposes:

1. To demostrate the capabilities of Xamarin Forms
2. To show how to use Xamarin Forms as its documentation is neither completed nor thorought
3. To produce a bunch of high quality Xamarin Forms controls (with documents)
4. To burn my spare time
